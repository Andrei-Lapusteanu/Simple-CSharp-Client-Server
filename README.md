# Simple-CSharp-Client-Server
## Summary
 The application represents a simple implementation of a client-server.

# Technologies
- Written exclusively in **C#** with the help of the **System.Net.Sockets** namespace
- UI written in **WPF**

# Functionality
- Software allows starting a **local server** on a user defined **socket (IP + port)**
- The **client handler** allows multiple concurrent client connections to the server
- Being a very simple implementation, client can connect to the server, for example, using **PuTTY**, and the messages sent will appear inside the main text box
